Ingenic jz4780 pin controller

Required properties:
- compatible: "ingenic,jz4780-pinctrl"

- reg: Should contain the physical address and length of the GPIO port
  configuration registers (PAPIN..PFDRVHC).

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

For the jz4780, pin control is tightly bound with GPIO ports. All pins may
be used as GPIOs, multiplexed device functions are configured within the
GPIO port configuration registers and it is typical to refer to pins using the
naming scheme "PxN" where x is a character identifying the GPIO port with
which the pin is associated and N is an integer from 0 to 31 identifying the
pin within that GPIO port. For example PA0 is the first pin in GPIO port A, and
PB31 is the last pin in GPIO port B. The jz4780 contains 6 GPIO ports, PA to
PF, for a total of 192 pins.

Each subnode of the pin controller node is either a GPIO controller node, a pin
configuration node or a pin function node.

Required GPIO controller node properties:
- gpio-controller: Identifies this node as a GPIO controller.

- #gpio-cells: Should contain the integer 2.

Optional GPIO controller node properties:
- ingenic,pull-ups: A bit mask identifying the pins associated with this GPIO
  port which feature a pull-up resistor.

- ingenic,pull-downs: A bit mask identifying the pins associated with this GPIO
  port which feature a pull-down resistor.

Each pin of the jz4780 may feature a single bias resistor, thus there should be
no bits which are set in both ingenic,pull-ups & ingenic,pull-downs.

Pin configuration nodes use generic pinconf properties to specify an electrical
configuration of a pin. The only configurable property of a jz4780 pin is
whether to enable its bias resistor. Thus the only supported pinconf properties
are:

- bias-disable
- bias-pull-up
- bias-pull-down

No arguments are supported for any of these properties, and any subnode of the
pin controller node which contains any of these properties will be treated as a
pin configuration node. For more information about generic pinconfig properties,
see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt

Every other subnode of the pin controller node (that is, every subnode which
does not contain a gpio-controller or bias-* property) will be treated as a pin
function node. These subnodes represent a functionality of the SoC which may be
exposed through one or more groups of pins, represented as subnodes of the pin
function node. For example a function may be uart0, which may be exposed
through the group of pins PF0 to PF3.

Required pin function node properties:
- None.

Optional pin function node properties:
- None.

Each subnode of a pin function node is a pin group node.

Required pin group node properties:
- ingenic,pins: A set of values representing the pins within this pin group and
  their configuration. Four values should be provided for each pin:

  - The phandle of the GPIO controller node for the GPIO port within which the
    pin is found.

  - The index of the pin within its GPIO port (an integer in the range 0 to 31
    inclusive).

  - The index of the shared function port to be programmed in the GPIO port
    registers. Tables of these may be found in the jz4780 programming manual
    within the "General-Purpose I/O Ports" -> "Overview" section.

  - The phandle of a pin configuration node specifying the electrical
    configuration that should be applied to the pin.

For example the function 'msc0' may be exposed through 2 different pin groups,
one in GPIO port A and one in GPIO port E:

  pincfg_nobias: nobias {
    bias-disable;
  };

  pinfunc_msc0: msc0 {
    pins_msc0_pa: msc0-pa {
      ingenic,pins = <&gpa  4 1 &pincfg_nobias   /* d4 */
                      &gpa  5 1 &pincfg_nobias   /* d5 */
                      &gpa  6 1 &pincfg_nobias   /* d6 */
                      &gpa  7 1 &pincfg_nobias   /* d7 */
                      &gpa 18 1 &pincfg_nobias   /* clk */
                      &gpa 19 1 &pincfg_nobias   /* cmd */
                      &gpa 20 1 &pincfg_nobias   /* d0 */
                      &gpa 21 1 &pincfg_nobias   /* d1 */
                      &gpa 22 1 &pincfg_nobias   /* d2 */
                      &gpa 23 1 &pincfg_nobias   /* d3 */
                      &gpa 24 1 &pincfg_nobias>; /* rst */
    };

    pins_msc0_pe: msc0-pe {
      ingenic,pins = <&gpe 20 0 &pincfg_nobias   /* d0 */
                      &gpe 21 0 &pincfg_nobias   /* d1 */
                      &gpe 22 0 &pincfg_nobias   /* d2 */
                      &gpe 23 0 &pincfg_nobias   /* d3 */
                      &gpe 28 0 &pincfg_nobias   /* clk */
                      &gpe 29 0 &pincfg_nobias>; /* cmd */
    };
  };

For the jz4780 pin controller, a pin configuration node is synonymous with a
pin group node. Thus in the msc0 example above the nodes labeled pins_msc0_pa
and pins_msc0_pe may be used as pin configuration nodes.
