Ingenic jz4780 SoC OTG controller binding

The Ingenic jz4780 SoC includes an OTG compliant USB host controller
interface for use with USB 1.1 and 2.0 devices.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "ingenic,jz4780-otg".
 - reg: Should contain the address & size of the otg controller registers.
 - interrupts: Should specify the interrupt provided by interrupt-parent.
 - clocks: Should contain two clocks for otg_phy and otg1

Optional properties:
 - interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle of the interrupt controller that
   delivers interrupts to the otg block.


Example SoC include file:

/ {
	otg: jz4780-otg@0x13500000 {
		compatible = "ingenic,jz4780-otg";
		reg = <0x13500000 0x40000>;

		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <21>;

		clocks = <&cgu JZ4780_CLK_OTGPHY> <&cgu JZ4780_CLK_OTG1>;
		clock-names = "otg_phy", "otg1";
	};
};
