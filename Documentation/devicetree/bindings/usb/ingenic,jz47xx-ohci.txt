Ingenic jz47xx SoC OHCI controller binding

The Ingenic jz47xx SoC includes an OHCI compliant USB host controller
interface for use with USB 1.1 devices.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "ingenic,jz4780-OHCI" or "ingenic,jz4740-OHCI"
 - reg: Should contain the address & size of the OHCI controller registers.
 - interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle of the interrupt controller that
   delivers interrupts to the OHCI block.
 - interrupts: Should specify the interrupt provided by interrupt-parent.
 - clocks: Should contain a single clock specifier for the SoC UHC clock.
 - ingenic,vbus-gpio: Should be a gpio-list specifying the GPIO used to drive
   VBUS.

Example SoC include file for jz4780:

/ {
	ohci: jz4780-ohci@0x134a0000 {
		compatible = "ingenic,jz4780-ohci";
		reg = <0x134a0000 0x10000>;

		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <5>;

		clocks = <&cgu JZ4780_CLK_UHC>;
		clock-names = "uhc";
	};
};

Example board file:

&ohci {
	ingenic,vbus-gpio = <&gpf 15 0>;
};
